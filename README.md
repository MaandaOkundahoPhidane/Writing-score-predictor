# Writing-score-predictor
A machine learning tool that predicts a student's writing score based on demographic and academic factors like math score, reading proficiency, and parental education level.

This project implements a machine learning model to predict student writing performance. Using inputs such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, math score, and reading score, the model estimates a writing score out of 100.

The repository includes the trained model, a user-friendly MATLAB GUI application, data analysis notebooks, and a full project report. This serves as a demonstration of applying predictive analytics to educational outcomes.


**Key Features:**

- Predictive Model: Loads a pre-trained regression model for instant predictions.

- User-Friendly GUI: A MATLAB-based interface for easy interaction, replacing command-line inputs.

- Data Analysis: Jupyter notebooks exploring the dataset and model performance.

- Complete Documentation: Includes a detailed report on methodology, insights, and conclusions.
